Quantitative analysis of nobel prize speeches in R

Fun project by Raphael Gall. 

Literature and peace are the corpus for the text analysis. All available speeches betwee the 1940s to today. form the corpus. Publicly available on http://www.nobelprize.org One of my favorite speeches is http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1949/faulkner-speech.html '[...] There is only the question: When will I be blown up? Because of this, the young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat.'

The technologies like information extraction, summarization, categorization, clustering and information visualization, are used in the text mining process.

ylab = "Word frequencies")

set.seed(142)   
dark2 <- brewer.pal(6, "Dark2")   
wordcloud(names(freq), freq, max.words=100, rot.per=0.2, colors=dark2) 

#Hierarchal Clustering
plot(fit, hang=-1)
groups <- cutree(fit, k=5)   # "k=" defines the number of clusters you are using   
rect.hclust(fit, k=5, border="red") # draw dendogram with red borders around the 5 clusters   

#k-means clustering
dclust  <- dist(t(dtmss), method="euclidian")   
kfit    <- kmeans(dclust, 5)   
clusplot(as.matrix(d), kfit$cluster, color=T, shade=T, labels=2, lines=0)
